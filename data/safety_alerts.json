Due to the frequency of safety incidents\noccurring during rope access operations (Figure 1), BSEE is informing workers of\npotential dangers and providing recommendations to help prevent future injuries.\nRecent incidents include the following:\n\u2022  During an inspection of an overboard water caisson, a worker fell approximately\n90 feet when the main line of the self-retracting lanyard (SRL) slipped, failing to\nstop the fall. The worker\u2019s leg struck a pipe clamp support during the fall, which\nresulted in a laceration to the shin. The investigation determined that the self-\nbraking belay used at the anchor point for the primary line was incorrectly\nrigged.\n\u2022  A worker fell while preparing a transporter for blowout preventer operations. A\ncombination of circumstances contributed to the worker\u2019s injuries. Among the\nfactors cited were slippery surfaces, exhaustion, and increased distance to an\nanchor point, which caused the worker to swing from an unsafe angle rather\nthan drop vertically (Figure 2). When the worker lost footing and grip, the\nresulting swing caused a much more severe outcome since the worker was\npositioned far from the center point where the SRL was anchored.\nBSEE recommends that operators and their contractors, where appropriate,\nconsider the following:\n\u2022  Know the lanyard or SRL system\u2019s limitations and always work at angles less\nthan recommended. It is considered extremely dangerous to use a lanyard or\nSRL at more than 15 degrees from vertical; however, some systems will allow\nup to 22.5 degrees from vertical. Check the manufacturer\u2019s recommended\nsafe practices.\n\u2022  Ensure workers requiring fall protection make it a priority to check the\ncondition and know the correct usage of their fall arrest systems. Additionally,\nit is crucial for workers to be physically and mentally prepared to engage in\nthese procedures.\n\u2022  Perform a thorough inspection of all components of an SRL before each use,\nchecking the condition and verifying there are no cracks, rips, or\nmalfunctioning parts.\n\u2022  Make sure to use and implement appropriate fall protection.\n\u2022  Create and adhere to a strict job safety analysis and follow the requirements\nfor self-retracting lifelines.\n\u2022  Certify that training has been completed and is current for any employee who\nmight be exposed to fall hazards.\n\u2022  Perform multiple checks to ensure SRL\u2019s are functioning and properly rigged.\n\u2022  Have a site-specific rescue plan in place.\n\u2022  Be aware of the working conditions and environment. Exercise caution in wet\nor slippery conditions, use additional personal protective equipment and other\nsafety systems when necessary, and always ensure the structural integrity of\nanchor points.\n\u2013 BSEE \u2013\nA Safety Alert is a tool used by BSEE to inform the offshore oil and gas industry of the\ncircumstances surrounding a potential safety issue.

At the time of the incident, rig personnel had positioned a rack with\n12 nitrogen cylinders to begin pre-charging the accumulator system cylinders with\nnitrogen. One of the nitrogen cylinders within the rack subsequently ruptured at its base,\nresulting in the dispersion of both the nitrogen cylinders and debris that was within the\nrack, as well as of the remaining cylinders situated in the immediate and port aft areas\nof the rig. Three rig personnel sustained minor injuries from shrapnel.\nThe failure of the nitrogen cylinder, which is attributed to corrosive wall loss exacerbated\nby environmental factors and structural conditions, highlights critical vulnerabilities in the\nstorage and maintenance of nitrogen cylinders, particularly in marine environments. The\npresence of crevices at the base of the cylinders, combined with moisture accumulation,\nsignificantly accelerated the corrosion process, leading to the hazardous failure. Heavy\ndeterioration of the galvanic coating on the storage rack further compounded the failure,\nindicating systemic neglect of maintenance protocols that could prevent such incidents.\nBSEE recommends that operators and their contractors, where appropriate, do\nthe following:\n\u2022  Ensure that all cylinders are properly labeled and marked with the appropriate\nUnited States Department of Transportation (DOT) identification number.\n\u2022  Verify that all cylinders are within their recertification period and have been\nproperly recertified.\n\u2022  Ensure that all cylinders are filled to the appropriate pressure and the filling\nprocess is properly documented.\n\u2022  Train all personnel handling and transporting high-pressure cylinders on the\nproper procedures and safety precautions.\n\u2022  Train all personnel on the importance of monitoring environmental conditions and\nidentifying the early signs of corrosion.\n\u2022  Foster a culture of safety and diligence regarding the handling and maintenance\nof gas cylinders.\n\u2022  Regularly review and update high-pressure cylinder safety procedures to ensure\n\u2022\ncompliance with current DOT regulations.\nImplement a robust inspection program and monitoring system to track the\ncondition of high-pressure cylinders and storage racks regularly. Establish a\nreporting mechanism for any observed deterioration or safety concerns.\n\u2022  Establish a routine maintenance schedule that includes cleaning, inspection, and\nprotective coating application to prevent corrosion. This should also involve\nchecking for and addressing any crevices or pooling of water around the bases of\nthe cylinders.\nBy addressing these recommendations, the risk of future failures can be significantly\nreduced, ensuring the safety of personnel and the integrity of the storage system.\n\u2013 BSEE \u2013\nA Safety Alert is a tool used by BSEE to inform the offshore oil and gas industry of the\ncircumstances surrounding a potential safety issue.

The incident occurred after a turbine generator shut down,\nscattering pieces of perforated steel from inside the turbine silencer onto the deck. The lack\nof proper maintenance and safety precautions could potentially have led to severe injuries or\nfatalities had personnel been present at the time the debris fell.\nIncident Overview:\nDuring offshore energy production operations, personnel reported an unusual sound and\nnoticed the exhaust expansion joint pulsing on turbine generator No. 3 (TGen3). Operators\ninitiated troubleshooting procedures, and mechanics recommended shutting down TGen3\nusing standard protocols. Emergency stop procedures were avoided over concerns that rapid\nunloading could cause catastrophic turbine engine failure or a power blackout.\nAfter TGen3 was shut down, a walkdown revealed pieces of perforated steel from inside the\nsilencer (Figure 1) scattered on the deck (Figure 2), some weighing as much as 44 pounds.\nThe steel had failed around the supporting struts and was ejected from the silencer exhaust\ntip approximately 110 feet above the deck (Figure 3).\nFigure 1: Looking up at the silencer.\nFigure 2: Perforated steel section.\nFigure 3: Fall distance.\nThe silencer was supported by eight struts, welded on both sides without backing support.\nVisual inspections showed no weld failures. No alarms or performance issues were noted in\nthe control room, and no personnel were in the area at the time.\nThe offshore facility is powered by three LM2500 turbine generators (TGens), typically\nrequiring two to operate simultaneously. Unlike TGen1 and TGen2, which have Waste Heat\nRecovery Units and limited silencer use, TGen3 operates in a simple cycle, routing all\nexhaust through the silencer.\nThe TGen3 silencer, which has been in continuous service for 18 years, features an 82-inch\ninlet and outlet and is designed to reduce exhaust noise to 85 decibels at three feet. The\nincident occurred after the silencer had undergone 1,872 thermal cycles, with temperatures\nranging from ambient to 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Maintenance records showed that\nsilencers were not considered serviceable components, and inspections had been limited to\nthe exhaust plenum discharge flange.\nWhere appropriate, BSEE recommends that operators and their contractors consider\nthe following:\n\u2022  Define and implement comprehensive inspection and maintenance strategies for\nturbine engine exhaust components, including silencers, for new and existing\nequipment.\n\u2022  Ensure regular inspections go beyond the exhaust plenum discharge flange to include\nthe entire silencer assembly.\n\u2022\nIncorporate robust design specifications and quality assurance measures, including\nmanufacturer documentation for new silencers.\n\u2022  Establish and maintain strict dropped object prevention measures, especially in areas\nwhere personnel, hazardous materials, or equipment are at risk. These measures are\ncritical to protect workers and prevent injuries or damage.\nBy taking these precautions, operators can enhance safety and prevent similar incidents in\nthe future.\n\u2013 BSEE \u2013\nA Safety Alert is a tool used by BSEE to inform the offshore oil and gas industry of the\ncircumstances surrounding a potential safety issue.

During a facility walkthrough, operator personnel had identified grating\nnear a skid as a hazard due to corrosion and installed hard barricades to prevent\naccess. However, shortly thereafter, operator personnel installed two scaffolding boards\non top of the previously identified grating hazard and removed the hard barricades so\nwork could proceed (Figure 1). A worker tasked with installing a pump in the skid above\nthe unsafe grating was kneeling on the scaffolding boards with the tip of his boots\nresting on the grating when the corroded section of grating suddenly gave way (Figure\n2). The worker was able to quickly react, grabbing hold of a nearby section of piping to\nsupport himself. Upon further inspection, the worker later realized the 36 by 36-inch\npiece of grating beneath the scaffolding boards he was kneeling on had collapsed and\nfallen into the water.\nFollowing the incident, operator personnel placed additional boards over the resulting\nopen hole in the grating but did not install hard barricades or identify the area as a\nhazard.\nHard barricades were later reinstalled, and the grating was subsequently replaced.\nBSEE recommends that operators and their contractors, where appropriate, do\nthe following:\n\u2022  Review BSEE Notice to Lessees No. 2024-N03 Restricting Access to Unsafe\nAreas Due to Corrosion NOTE: Lessees and Operators are required to comply\nwith 30 CFR 250.107, What must I do to protect health, safety, property, and the\nenvironment by  \u201cmaintaining all equipment and work areas in a safe condition.\u201d\n30 CFR 250.107(a)(2).\n\u2022  Review in conjunction with this Safety Alert, BSEE Safety Alert 416 -\nInvestigation into Grating Failure Fatality Reveals Deficiencies, and BSEE Safety\nAlert 365 - BSEE Identified Grating and Open Hole Hazards During Risk Based\nInspections.\n\u2022  Conduct a thorough walkthrough of the facility to identify open holes and check\nthat potentially unsafe surfaces can safely support the weight of individuals\nworking on or around them. If such an area or open hole is identified, ensure it\nhas been properly barricaded and/or covered.\n\u2022  Review internal and contractor Safe Work Practices to ensure that operations\npersonnel clearly understand the requirements and expectations for the use of\nbarricades.

Fantail areas of deepwater drilling rig where wave knocked worker down.\nThe Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) recently investigated an\nincident where rough sea conditions posed sudden and unpredictable risks. In addition,\nBSEE received multiple incident reports in November and December 2024, identifying\nadverse weather conditions as the primary contributing factor. This safety alert is being\nprovided as a reminder to establish and clearly communicate enhanced safety\nmeasures in anticipation of adverse weather.\nAn offshore worker on a deepwater drilling rig was heading to assist personnel in\npressure washing operations. Observing the job had been completed and the team was\nwrapping up, the worker then walked to the stern of the vessel toward the fantail to\nobserve waves from the handrails. While standing at the handrail, a wave crashed over,\nknocking the worker back approximately 20 feet, potentially coming into contact with a\nbollard before landing at the base of the stairs (Figure1). As a result of the incident, the\nworker sustained a fracture to the right upper leg femur.\nOn the morning of the incident, it was noted that sea conditions were noticeably\nworsening. The aft deck (stern) was secured, and crane operations were suspended in\nresponse. Despite not having any active duties or assignments in that location, the\noffshore worker made a personal decision to access the stern to observe the water. The\ndecision to access a secured area put the worker in a location vulnerable to the impact\nof the wave, which directly led to their injury. The rough sea conditions were the primary\ncontributing factor, as the rough seas presented sudden and unpredictable risks. The\nroot cause of this incident was the weather\nAdditional incidents reported to BSEE in November and December 2024, where the root\ncause was determined to be weather:\n\u2022  An offshore worker was attempting to swing from a boat landing to the back of a\nmotor vessel when a large wave came through and pushed the stern of the boat\nunder the boat landing. When the stern came loose, the worker lost balance and\nfell on the deck, injuring a knee.\n\u2022  Operators were transferring personnel from a motor vessel onto a production\nplatform. During the transfer, a rogue sea swell caused the boat to collide with\nthe boat landing, damaging the west side of the facility.\n\u2022  A motor vessel was preparing to use dynamic positioning (DP) to offload\npersonnel onto a facility. During this process, the vessel temporarily lost its DP\ncapability, and a sea swell pushed it toward the boat landing. As a result, the\nbulwark and jump deck were pushed beneath the personnel landing area on the\nfacility, causing damage to the vessel.\nBSEE recommends that operators and their contractors, where appropriate, do\nthe following:\n\u2022  Determine if there should be restricted areas on the facility during adverse\nweather conditions and communicate these locations to all personnel during pre-\ntour and other relevant meetings.\n\u2022  Place additional restricted access signs and/or hard barriers around the facility\nbased on weather-related restrictions set by the offshore facility leadership.\n\u2022  Ensure personnel are aware of hazards from unlikely sources that could be\npresent during extreme weather events with unpredictable conditions (seas,\nwinds, etc.).\n\u2022  Determine when non-critical work should be suspended due to unfavorable\nconditions to prioritize safety.\n\u2022  Assess medical evacuation capabilities and challenges for and during adverse\nweather conditions.\n\u2022  Review BSEE Safety Alert 363 - Injury Occurs when Non-evacuated Personnel\nEnter Weather-restricted Area, BSEE Safety Alert 392 - Personnel Transfer\nInjuries Escalate Over 1-Year Period, and BSEE Safety Alert 456 - Extreme\nCaution Advised During Swing Rope Transfers in conjunction with this Safety\nAlert.\n\u2013 BSEE \u2013\nA Safety Alert is a tool used by BSEE to inform the offshore oil and gas industry of the\ncircumstances surrounding a potential safety issue.

Test separator and 500-barrel tank.\nFigure 2. Generator.\nThe Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) recently investigated an\nexplosion and subsequent fire that occurred on a liftboat during well cleanup and testing\noperations. Two contract workers suffered second-degree burns. This event\nunderscores critical shortcomings in procedural controls, equipment readiness, and\nemergency response during offshore oil and gas operations.\nThe explosion was caused by a gas accumulation on the liftboat deck during the\ndraining of fluids from a test separator into a 500-barrel tank (Figure 1). The night\nsupervisor initiated the draining process, and five minutes later, a surge in the generator\nengine (Figure 2) triggered the explosion and multiple fires. Two contract workers were\ninjured, suffering burns to their faces, necks, and hands. The liftboat's fire suppression\nsystem extinguished the fire within 15 minutes.\nHowever, the evacuation of the injured workers faced logistical delays, resulting in their\narrival at a medical facility nearly five hours after the incident. This delay underscores\nthe importance of having robust personnel evacuation and medical response plans in\nplace.\nContributing Factors\nAn investigation by BSEE identified several procedural and equipment deficiencies:\n\u2022  No formal procedures existed for draining fluids from separators or preparing the\n500-barrel tank for testing.\n\u2022  Workers relied on hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-specific gas detectors, which could not\ndetect explosive gas mixtures.\n\u2022  The generator\u2019s air intake shutoff valve control module failed to function, allowing\ngas infiltration.\nImproperly latched hatches on the tank allowed gas to escape.\n\u2022\n\u2022  Night shift safety meetings lacked oversight by company representatives, reducing\ncommunication effectiveness.\n\u2022  Workers reported holding level controllers open until gas blow-by was detected,\nincreasing risk to personnel safety and operations.\n\u2022  Loose hatch bolts on the tank, caused during transport, were not adequately\ninspected upon arrival.\nTo prevent similar incidents, BSEE recommends that operators and their\ncontractors, where appropriate, consider the following actions:\n\u2022  Establish comprehensive written procedures for all critical operations, including\ndraining fluids from separators and preparing tanks for well tests. Regularly review\nand update standard operating and safety procedures to align with industry best\npractices.\n\u2022  Equip workers with multi-gas detectors capable of identifying a wide range of\nhazardous gases, not just H2S.\n\u2022\nInstall fixed multi-gas detection systems on liftboats and work decks for continuous\nmonitoring.\n\u2022  Conduct a thorough inspection of vessel hatches to ensure a proper seal.\n\u2022  Conduct thorough inspections of tanks, generators, and flame arrestors before and\nafter transport to ensure proper function and secure fittings.\n\u2022  Test the automatic air intake shutoff valve before starting operations, ensuring it\nfunctions properly.\n\u2022  Require operator representatives to participate in all safety meetings to enhance\ncommunication and adherence to protocols.\n\u2022  Conduct comprehensive hazard analyses for all operations, particularly gas handling\nand fluid transfer.

The ROV operator had completed an inspection\ndive of the drilling riser and Blow Out Preventor (BOP) and was in the process of\nrecovering the unit from the water.\nAfter the ROV was nested in the Launch and Recovery System (LARS) cursor, the unit\ncleared the surface and traveled the vessel cursor rails up to the cursor transition point.\nAt the transition point, the operator stopped hauling in the umbilical winch and cursor\nassist tuggers to switch the umbilical winch to low-tension mode.\nAs the ROV reached the cursor rail transition point, the umbilical parted, causing the\nROV to drop to the seafloor. The ROV was subsequently located and recovered using\nits transponder. No damage to any seabed assets or harm to personnel occurred.\nCause: The incident was traced back to a flaw in the initial umbilical attachment. A resin\nwas used to secure the umbilical to the ROV, but the resin case was faulty, and the\narmored strands were improperly centered and distributed during the attachment\nprocess (Figure 2).

The incident occurred while transferring a partial 3/8-inch steel plate sheet\nusing a magnetic lifting device. During the lift, the steel plate unexpectedly detached\nfrom the magnet and fell approximately 47 inches, landing on top of both individuals\u2019 left\nfeet. Both personnel reported bruising and swelling and were evacuated for medical\nevaluation.\nThe investigation revealed that the magnetic lifting device was ineffective due  to wear\nand tear. Manufacturer tests indicated that wear damage to the lifting device could\ncreate air gaps, preventing it from functioning effectively. Additionally, the job safety\nanalysis (JSA) conducted before the operation did not adequately address the specific\nhazards associated with the lifting equipment. While the JSA noted general hazards, it\nfailed to identify the risk of the plate prematurely releasing from the lifting device.\nA critical factor in this incident was the personnel\u2019s failure to stop work and review the\nJSA before proceeding with the lifting operation. This judgment lapse reflects a safety\nculture where crew members did not feel empowered to halt operations to reassess\npotential hazards. Furthermore, there was a perception of haste among the personnel,\nwhich may have contributed to their decision to proceed without thoroughly discussing\nthe risks associated with the lifting operation. This urgency to complete tasks\nunderscores the need for improved communication and adherence to safety protocols.\nBSEE recommends that operators and their contractors, where appropriate, do\nthe following:\n\u2022  Revise job plans to ensure that the team adequately addresses specific hazards\nassociated with lifting gear and suspended loads..\n\u2022  Conduct thorough JSAs that include a comprehensive hazard assessment for all\nlifting operations.\n\u2022  Foster a culture of safety that encourages personnel to stop work and discuss\npotential hazards whenever uncertainties arise.\n\u2022  Train all personnel on the proper use of lifting equipment and the importance of\nconfirming that all safety mechanisms are engaged before lifting operations\ncommence.\n\u2022\nImplement a robust inspection program for lifting devices to ensure they are\nmaintained in safe working condition and regularly evaluated for wear and tear.\n\u2022  Establish a reporting mechanism for any observed defects or safety concerns\nrelated to lifting equipment.\n\u2022  Operators should know that even brief power spikes can disable electromagnets,\nleading to dropped loads. To prevent sudden loss of magnetization, implement\nprocedures to monitor power stability and ensure that backup systems are in\nplace.\n\u2022  Set guidelines to prevent coils from burning out by limiting how long operators\npower on electromagnets. Train operators to turn off the magnets when they are\nnot in use, especially if the magnets are not designed for continuous duty cycles..\n\u2022  Look into the implementing industry-standard pre-use inspection and load testing\nprocedures for magnetic lifting devices. ASME B.30.20-3 provides guidelines for\nmarking, construction, operation, and specific pre-use protocols, such as\nthorough inspections to ensure that the lifting surface is clean and free from\ndebris, oil, paint, or rust, which can interfere with the magnet\u2019s contact and\nreduce lifting capacity. Visual inspections should be supplemented with functional\ntests to verify lifting capabilities.\n\u2022  Encourage open communication among crew members regarding safety\npractices and adhering to established protocols.\n\u2013 BSEE \u2013\nA Safety Alert is a tool used by BSEE to inform the offshore oil and gas industry of the\ncircumstances surrounding a potential safety issue.

A data historian is a software application that collects, stores, and\nretrieves time-series data from various sources, allowing operators to analyze\nhistorical data related to alarms, control actions, and other operational events.\n\u2022  BSEE found that operators commonly utilized a \u201cmaintenance bypass\u201d whenever\nthey needed a bypass. A \u201cmaintenance bypass\u201d offers more robustness than a\nstandard bypass. With a standard bypass, an operator can choose a specific\nfunction to bypass for a particular device. In contrast, a \u201cmaintenance bypass\u201d\nstops the device from triggering the safety system across the entire 4-20 mA\nrange and beyond, even if the device experiences a fault or loses power.\n\u2022\n\u201cMaintenance bypasses\u201d are popular because operators can use the same\nbypass function for startup, maintenance, and testing, thereby preventing\nnuisance trips. However, during startup, a \"maintenance bypass\" may be\nselected for a pressure transmitter that provides both pressure safety high (PSH)\nand pressure safety low (PSL) functions. In this case, the PSH and PSL are\ndisabled, rather than just bypassing the PSL. BSEE has found that in some\nstartup situations, it is unnecessary to bypass the PSH. In these cases, this\npractice fails to meet the \"minimum\" number of devices that can be bypassed\naccording to 30 CFR 250.869, which increases operational risk by disabling\nprimary pressure protection.\n\u2022  BSEE found that some platforms had actions entitled \u201cgroup bypass selectors.\u201d\nThis option bypasses several devices at once and is useful for some applicable\noperations. In most scenarios, control room operators and their competency were\nthe only barrier to ensuring the minimum number of devices in bypass. For\nexample, the operator did not have a preset list of minimum bypasses that are\nneeded for common operations on the facility.\n\u2022  BSEE found that some operators kept devices in bypass for longer durations.\nOperators cited nuisance trips and alarms, such as sea state and weather, for\nreasons associated with bypasses for extended periods on sumps and\nemergency shutdown devices (ESDs) at the boat landing. One operator had\nexamples of allowable bypasses extending for 12 hours and only requiring a\nconversation with a control room operator and the offshore installation manager.\n\u2022  During the inspection, multiple operators indicated that they were allowed to\nplace devices in bypass for \u201crepair\u201d and \u201ctroubleshooting.\u201d Multiple operators had\ndifferent interpretations of 30 CFR 250.869A, which states, \u201cSurface or\nsubsurface safety devices must not be bypassed or blocked out of service unless\nthey are temporarily out of service for startup, maintenance, or testing.\u201d\nSpecifically, \u201cmaintenance\u201d was not well defined within operator procedures.\n\u2022  Multiple operators had safety system bypass procedures requiring certain\npersonnel to review adherence to the operator\u2019s procedure by conducting an\naudit. The audit\u2019s results and actions were also required to be documented and\nshared with relevant personnel. Unfortunately, the operator did not provide audits\nof this nature or scope were not provided by the operator for the subject facilities\nto BSEE during the PBRI.\n\u2022  BSEE found one instance where an operator had mistakenly bypassed the entire\nsafety system while the facility was producing. In this case, a project team altered\nladder logic to bypass groups of devices that were needed for the construction\nprocess while the facility was offline. However, when the facility went back online,\nthese ladder logic changes were not reverted, and entire groups of devices were\nunknowingly in bypass.\nAs a result of these findings, BSEE recommends:\n\u2022  Operators should document all authorized safety system bypasses, inhibits, or\noverrides in logs that capture identification tags, equipment identification,\nreasons, applications, and removal details. If data historians cannot capture this\ndata, a written process should document all bypasses.\n\u2022  Operators should document any changes to the ladder logic needed for\nconstruction and ensure that these changes are reverted before the project's\ncompletion.\n\u2022  Operators should evaluate their offshore data historian and determine if they can\nrecord and store electronic data records when operator interventions occur.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nIndustry should ensure that a computer-based system's human-machine\ninterface (HMI) can display all bypassed safety devices and operational\nconditions.\nIndustry should review and document bypasses associated with \u201crepair\u201d and\n\u201ctroubleshooting.\u201d Any bypass should include the date and time of the installation\nand removal of the bypass and the reason. Also, if the bypass is associated with\nany \u201crepairs\u201d or \u201ctroubleshooting,\u201d supporting documentation should be included\nwithin the bypass log to capture the associated work activity. Operators should\nconsider referencing API RP 14C 8th edition for bypass applications regarding\n\u201cmaintenance\u201d activities: Maintenance bypasses allow repairing a failed or failing\nsafety function device without a process upset.\n\u2022  Operators should develop systems to verify compliance with their safety system\nbypass procedures.\n\u2013 BSEE \u2013\nA Safety Alert is a tool used by BSEE to inform the offshore oil and gas industry of the\ncircumstances surrounding a potential safety issue. It also contains recommendations that\ncould assist avoiding potential incidents on the Outer Continental Shelf.\nCategory: Process Safety, Personnel Safety"

The failure led to an immediate\nplatform shut-in and a full muster of personnel onboard.\nThe released gas posed a significant safety risk, particularly due to its proximity\u2014within\n10 feet\u2014to hot compressor surfaces, increasing the potential for fire or explosion.\nFortunately, there were no injuries or significant equipment damage; however, the event\nhighlights how minor component failures can escalate into serious safety threats under\nslightly altered conditions.\nIncident Findings:\nPost-incident inspection revealed that the threaded \u00be-inch pipe nipple failed due to\nfatigue cracking, which had likely developed progressively over time (Figure 2). The\nfatigue cracking was consistent with long-term exposure to mechanical stress and\ncyclical loading in a high-vibration environment. Threaded connections of this size are\nespecially vulnerable to fatigue when installed on vibrating equipment such as\ncompressors.\nContributing Factors:\n\u2022  Over-tightening: Excessive torque during installation may have introduced\nstress concentrations, weakening the pipe.\n\u2022  Vibration: Continuous vibration from compressor operations likely accelerated\nfatigue.\n\u2022  Unsupported Weight: The nipple also supported a sight glass level bridle,\npotentially adding stress to the connection.\n\u2022  Component Loosening: Vibration may have contributed to the loosening of the\nconnection over time, compounding mechanical stress.\nTo help prevent similar incidents in the future, BSEE recommends that operators\nand their contractors, where appropriate, consider the following:\n\u2022  Add structural support for sight glass level bridles attached to compressor suction\nscrubbers to reduce weight and vibration loads on small-diameter pipe nipples.\n\u2022  Apply proper tightening techniques to avoid over-stressing threaded connections\nduring installation.\n\u2022  Regularly inspect critical components\u2014including pipe nipples, fittings, and\nsupports\u2014for signs of fatigue, corrosion, wear, or loosening. Initiate timely\ncorrective actions as needed.\n\u2022\nImplement vibration monitoring on compressor packages to detect and manage\nvibration levels that may affect connected piping and equipment.\n\u2022  Ensure vibration dampers are properly installed and maintained to reduce the\ntransmission of vibration from compressor units to piping components.\n\u2013 BSEE \u2013\nA Safety Alert is a tool used by BSEE to inform the offshore oil and gas industry of the\ncircumstances surrounding a potential safety issue.
